Week 1 (11/30-12/2)
This week I unfortunately missed, and was not at school. I did however check out the logistics of the
camel game, and of the graphics reading.

Week 2 (12/5-12/11)
This week I decided what I wanted to make for my game, and met with my music people. I decided to make
an animal, specifically duck themed alien/shooter game where the spaceship is fixed to a certain horizontal
line, and then fires at aliens/things that are above it.
I also programmed and finished my camel game, and started reading the graphics section, and also test
out some of the graphics instructions.
I also worked to get my github back online, and am still currently trying to trace it back so that
everything is synced up.
