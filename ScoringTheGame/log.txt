Week 1 (11/30-12/2)
This week I unfortunately missed, and was not at school. I did however check out the logistics of the
camel game, and of the graphics reading.

Week 2 (12/5-12/11)
This week I decided what I wanted to make for my game, and met with my music people. I decided to make
an animal, specifically duck themed alien/shooter game where the spaceship is fixed to a certain horizontal
line, and then fires at aliens/things that are above it.
I also programmed and finished my camel game, and started reading the graphics section, and also test
out some of the graphics instructions.
I also worked to get my github back online, and am still currently trying to trace it back so that
everything is synced up.

Camel Game looks good. Score: 5/5

Week 3 (12/12 - 12/16)
This week, after reconvening with my music group, I decided on a final theme/style for my game. I am going
to incorporate mainly ducks, but also other pond animals like frogs, and do the spaceship shooter structure.
I also finished going through chapter 5 tutorial this week, and also went through most of chapter 8 and got
to animating images. I also learned some basic ways of importing background images, as well as images for
parts of my game, and making the background of the smaller image see through (and so forth).

Week 4 (1/3-1/8)
This week I made a lot of progress with my duck game. I finally fixed the duck along a position on the
y axis, and made it so it will not go off screen, or get stuck on a side. I also imported a duck image for
the player, and started working on the shooting motion that the duck will do. So far I have programmed the
duck to have two shots, controlled with the space bar. I also imported a title "Pond Defenders". I also
programmed the shots to respawn at the position of the duck once they go off screen.

Week 5 (1/9-1/15)
This week I made a lot of progress with the shot motion in my game. I set up separate functions for each
of my five shots. I also read through chapter 12 and learned about classes. I am not completely done copying
my game and adding classes, but I am a good way through.
